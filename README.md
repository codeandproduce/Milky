# Milky
This is our project for WebHacks2017. 
We won 1st place in the hackathon with this project. 
We were written about in one of the sponsors' blog: https://blog.manifold.co/hackathon-spotlight-my-chat-with-webhacks-winner-milky-505dea8ddc9f

Milky was designed for you to organize your thoughts and ambitions amidst such a hasteful world. Many of us don't commit ourselves to achieving our deepest desires because it really is difficult to get started with anything. Milky aims to make an intuitive app to organize what you must do to accomplish what you want, in the clearest way possible. You will see what we mean once you see what we've made for you.

Basic usage:
1. Enter credientials such as your name, your goal, and some steps you need to accomplish.
2. The last step will require you to enter a link. You may change the text in the box to have a customized link for your goal.
3. Once inside the dashboard, you can use the buttons in the tab above to add or delete steps.
     -Clicking the step-type, for instance 'course', will change the step into a different type.
     -Clicking the progress-button, for instance 'start', will change the progress of the step.
4. Any change such as changing the description will only take effect if you click somewhere else in the interface.
5. You can still edit your name and your goal by directly editting the text in the tab above.
